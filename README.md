To print the pattern like 

for n=4
1*2*3*4
9*10*11*12
13*14*15*16
5*6*7*8

for n=5
1*2*3*4*5
11*12*13*14*15
21*22*23*24*25
16*17*18*19*20
6*7*8*9*10

for n=6
1*2*3*4*5*6
13*14*15*16*17*18
25*26*27*28*29*30
31*32*33*34*35*36
19*20*21*22*23*24
7*8*9*10*11*12

 I have made a program in C++ for generalisation of n which is total number of lines as well as total number of numbers in one line.
